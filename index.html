		<p>Hi, I'm a software engineer interested in opportunities in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
		<p>Previously, I worked for Google's Play Store from 2019 to 2023. While at Google, I worked on building
		   offline data and serving pipelines for Play Store's app recommendation engines, including working on
		   projects for improving the engagement and quality metrics.</p>
		<p>I have an MS in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, New York focused on Data-Driven Analysis
		   and Computation, and a BTech in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology,
		   Roorkee.</p>
		<p>I also had a brief stint as a Technology Associate at iRunway, which provided techological support for 
		   intellectual property disputes and monetization support to tech firms for managing their IP assets.</p>
		<p>Here's my updated <a href="resume_pp.pdf">resume</a>, with more details about coursework, internships
		   and programming languages.</p>
		<p>As a multi-dimensional entity, I have online presence at the following spots:
			<ul>
				<li>LinkedIn page at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratyuspati">@pratyuspati</a></li>
				<li>Github profile at <a href="https://github.com/prtysp">@prtysp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prtyspt">@prtyspt</a> (old) </li>
				<li>Email me at <a href="mailto:pratyus.pati@gmail.com">pratyus.pati@gmail.com</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Some of my past projects are:
			<ul>
				<li>Implementing Fractal Compression in OpenCL.</li>
				<li>Implementing Hindsight in Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm.</li>
				<li>Identifying Seminal Patents using Graph Algorithms.</li>
				<li>Researching methods to sparsify Artificial Neural Networks using regularization.</li>
				<li>Accelerated training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using model and data parallelism.</li>
				<li>etc...</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> Lately, I'm trying to learn how to write well. If something shows up below, it would seem I'm succeeding.</p>
